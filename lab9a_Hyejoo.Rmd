# Matching patterns with regular expressions


```{r}
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```
## Basic matches 
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

```{r}
# To create the regular expression, we need \\
dot <- "\\."

# But the expression itself only contains one:
writeLines(dot)
```

```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)
```

```{r}
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```

### Exercises 1
1. Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\".
* "\": Escape the next character in the string.
* "\\": Resolve to \ in the regular expression, which escape the next character in the regular expression.
* "\\\": The first two resolve to a literal backslash in the regular expression, the third escape the next character. So in the regular expression, this will escape some escaped character.

2. How would you match the sequence "'\?
```{r}
str_view("\"'\\", "\"'\\\\", match = TRUE)
```

3 What patterns will the regular expression \..\..\.. match? How would you represent it as a string?
```{r}
str_view(c(".a.b.c", ".a.b", "....."), c("\\..\\..\\.."), match = TRUE)
```

## Anchors

* ^ to match the start of the string.
* $ to match the end of the string.
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
```

```{r}
str_view(x, "a$")
```

```{r}
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")
```

```{r}
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```
### Exercises 2
1. How would you match the literal string "$^$"?
```{r}
str_view(c("$^$", "ab$^$sfas"), "^\\$\\^\\$$", match = TRUE)
```

2. Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that:
  ** Start with “y”.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^y", match = TRUE)
```

  * End with “x”
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "x$", match = TRUE)
```

  * Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using str_length()!)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(stringr::words, "^...$", match = TRUE)
```

  * Have seven letters or more.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(stringr::words, ".......", match = TRUE)
```

## Character classes and alternatives

* \d : matches any digit.
* \s : matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
* [abc] : matches a, b, or c.
* [^abc] : matches anything except a, b, or c.

```{r}
# Look for a literal character that normally has special meaning in a regex
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c")
str_view(x, "a[.]c")
```

```{r}
str_view(x, ".[*]c")
```

```{r}
str_view(x, "a[ ]")
```

```{r}
x <- c("grey", "gray")
str_view(x, "gr(e|a)y")
```


### Exercises 3
1. Create regular expressions to find all words that:
* Start with a vowel.
```{r}
str_subset(stringr::words, "^[aeiou]")
```

* That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
```{r}
str_subset(stringr::words, "[aeiou]", negate=TRUE)
```

* End with ed, but not with eed.
```{r}
str_subset(stringr::words, "[^e]ed$")
```

* End with ing or ise.
```{r}
str_subset(stringr::words, "i(ng|se)$")
```

2. Empirically verify the rule “i before e except after c”.
```{r}
length(str_subset(stringr::words, "(cei|[^c]ie)"))
```

3. Is “q” always followed by a “u”?
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "q[^u]", match = TRUE)
```

4. Write a regular expression that matches a word if it’s probably written in British English, not American English.

5. Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.
```{r}
x <- c("123-4567-8901", "(123)4567-8901", "(123) 4567-8901")
str_view(x, "\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d")
```

## Repetition

* ?: 0 or 1
* +: 1 or more
* *: 0 or more

```{r}
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
```

```{r}
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')
```

* {n}: exactly n
* {n,}: n or more
* {,m}: at most m
* {n,m}: between n and m

```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2,}")
```

```{r}
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+?')
```

### Exercises 4
1. Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.
* ? = {0,1}
* + = {1,}
* * = {0,}
2. Describe in words what these regular expressions match
* ^.*$ = match with any string
* "\\{.+\\}" = match any string with curly braces surrounding at least one character
* \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} = four digits followed by a hyphen, followed by two digits followed by a hyphen, followed by another two digits
* "\\\\{4}" = four backslashes
3. Create regular expressions to find all words that:
* Start with three consonants.
```{r}
str_view(words, "^[^aeiou]{3}", match = TRUE)
```

* Have three or more vowels in a row.
```{r}
str_view(words, "[aeiou]{3,}", match = TRUE)
```

* Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
```{r}
str_view(words, "([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,}", match = TRUE)
```

## Grouping and backreferences
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

### Exercises 5
1. Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
* (.)\1\1 = Same character three times in a row
* "(.)(.)\\2\\1" =  A pair of characters followed by the same pair of characters in reversed order
* (..)\1 = two characters repeated
* "(.).\\1.\\1" = A character followed by any character, the original character, any other character, the original character again
* "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1" = Three characters followed by zero or more characters of any kind followed by the same three characters but in reverse order

# Tools
## Detect matches

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
```

```{r}
# How many common words start with t?
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
```

```{r}
# What proportion of common words end with a vowel?
mean(str_detect(words, "[aeiou]$"))
```

```{r}
# Find all words containing at least one vowel, and negate
no_vowels_1 <- !str_detect(words, "[aeiou]")
```

```{r}
# Find all words consisting only of consonants (non-vowels)
no_vowels_2 <- str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2)
```

```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "x$")]
```

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  word = words, 
  i = seq_along(word)
)
df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "x$"))
```

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_count(x, "a")
```

```{r}
# On average, how many vowels per word?
mean(str_count(words, "[aeiou]"))
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )
```

### Exercise 6
1. For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.
* Find all words that start or end with x.

```{r}
# one regex
words[str_detect(words, "^x|x$")]

# split regex into parts
start_with_x <- str_detect(words, "^x")
end_with_x <- str_detect(words, "x$")
words[start_with_x | end_with_x]
```
* Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
```{r}
str_subset(words, "^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$") %>% head()

start_with_vowel <- str_detect(words, "^[aeiou]")
end_with_consonant <- str_detect(words, "[^aeiou]$")
words[start_with_vowel & end_with_consonant] %>% head()
```

* Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
```{r}
pattern <-
  cross(rerun(5, c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")),
    .filter = function(...) {
      x <- as.character(unlist(list(...)))
      length(x) != length(unique(x))
    }
  ) %>%
  map_chr(~str_c(unlist(.x), collapse = ".*")) %>%
  str_c(collapse = "|")
```

```{r}
str_subset("aseiouds", pattern)

str_subset(words, pattern)

words[str_detect(words, "a") &
  str_detect(words, "e") &
  str_detect(words, "i") &
  str_detect(words, "o") &
  str_detect(words, "u")]
```

## Extract matches

```{r}
length(sentences)
```

```{r}
head(sentences)
```

```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match
```

```{r}
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(matches)
```
Above example has an error
```{r}
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match)
```

```{r}
str_extract(more, colour_match)

## To get all matches, use str_extract_all()
```

```{r}
## matrix with short matches expanded to the same length as the longest
str_extract_all(more, colour_match, simplify = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x <- c("a", "a b", "a b c")
str_extract_all(x, "[a-z]", simplify = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 7
In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.

```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
```

```{r}
colour_match2 <- str_c("\\b(", str_c(colours, collapse = "|"), ")\\b")
colour_match2

more2 <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]

str_view_all(more2, colour_match2, match = TRUE)
```

## Grouped matches
```{r}
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"

has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun) %>%
  head(10)
has_noun %>% 
  str_extract(noun)
```

```{r}
has_noun %>% 
  str_match(noun)
```

```{r}
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>% 
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)", 
    remove = FALSE
  )
```

### Exercise 8
Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.
```{r}
numword <- "\\b(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten) +(\\w+)"
sentences[str_detect(sentences, numword)] %>%
  str_extract(numword)
```

## Replacing matche

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

```{r}
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

```{r}
x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))
```

```{r}
sentences %>% 
  str_replace("([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)", "\\1 \\3 \\2") %>% 
  head(5)
```

### Exercise 9
Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.
```{r}
str_replace_all("past/present/future", "/", "\\\\")
```

## Splitting
```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ")
```

```{r}
"a|b|c|d" %>% 
  str_split("\\|") %>% 
  .[[1]]
```

```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE)
```

```{r}
fields <- c("Name: Hadley", "Country: NZ", "Age: 35")
fields %>% str_split(": ", n = 2, simplify = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x <- "This is a sentence.  This is another sentence."
str_view_all(x, boundary("word"))
```

```{r}
str_split(x, " ")[[1]]
```

```{r}
str_split(x, boundary("word"))[[1]]
```

### Exercise 10
Split up a string like “apples, pears, and bananas” into individual components.
```{r}
x <- c("apples, pears, and bananas")
str_split(x, ", +(and +)?")[[1]]
```
